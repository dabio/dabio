Hi, I'm Danilo Braband. I'm an iOS developer at [parku][1].

![Danilo Braband][3]

I spend the past two years working with an ecommerce agency to improve their online
shops. Outside my day job I've explored and learned a few programming languages and continue to practice those. I generally work with Go, Ruby, Objective-C, Git and Mac.

On a more personal note, I love swimming and cycling (I usually ride with the [Berlin Racing Team][2]). If you'd like to discuss something or need any advice, please shoot me an email. I'm pretty friendly.
