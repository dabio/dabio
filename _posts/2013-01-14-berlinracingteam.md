# [Berlin Racing Team][1]

Since my cycling endeavour started in 2008, I became a co-founder of the local cycling team [Berlin Racing Team][1]. We started with only four riders and growed to 25 cyclists in 2013.

As a web developer I am responsible for the online appearance of the team. Therefore two [Sinatra][2] apps were created. One for the frontend to serve the site and one for the backend to manage the content. The sources for the [frontend][4] and [backend][5] are on my [GitHub profile][3].
