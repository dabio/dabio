### [Berlin Racing Team][1]

Since my cycling endeavour started in 2008, I became a co-founder of the local cycling team [Berlin Racing Team][1]. We started with only four riders and growed to 20 cyclists in 2012. As a web developer I am responsible for the online appearance of the team. Therefore a small [Sinatra][2] app was created to manage and serve the website. The source can be [found on Github][3]. Make sure to check the [development branch][4].
